This is an individual assignment relating the homework for the duration of the summer holiday, which is programmed by artificial intelligence.<br>
The programming language is C++, and associated with EasyX, Win32 API, and a little of json(mainly used for AI chatting).<br>
The compiler is TDM-GCC which is downloaded to use EasyX, therefore, the "easyxrunner.bat" is used to run the code in other files(.cpp).<br>
The latex.pdf is designed for the programming which contains the theory and author's thoughts (in some extend, useless).<br>
