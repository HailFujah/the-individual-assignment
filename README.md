This is an individual assignment relating the homework for the duration of the summer holiday, which is programmed by artificial intelligence.
The programming language is C++, and associated with EasyX, Win32 API, and a little of json(mainly used for AI chatting).
The compiler is TDM-GCC which is downloaded to use EasyX, therefore, the "easyxrunner.bat" is used to run the code in other files(.cpp).
The latex.pdf is designed for the programming which contains the theory and suthor's thoughts (in some extend, useless).
